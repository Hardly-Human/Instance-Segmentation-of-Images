### For Local host.üíª

`git clone https://github.com/Hardly-Human/Instance-Segmentation-of-Images`

`cd Instance-Segmentation-of-Images`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`streamlit run app.py`

__App opens a window in Default Browser Automatically..__

### Future Development
 - Instance segmentation is a computation intensive task, many deployment scenarios are under progress to put this app into production.
 - Any contribution of GPU Environment deployments would be extremely helpful..
